# Hey Folks👋 

I'm Saniya Inayath

🟣 **Cyber Techie | Aspiring Purple Teamer**

I’m a Cyber Techie with a growing interest in **Purple Teaming**, where I focus on understanding how attacks happen and how they can be detected, analyzed, and mitigated.

I’m currently learning, experimenting, and **documenting my cybersecurity journey** through hands-on labs, security testing projects, and small tools as I progress.

## 🧠 What I'm Currently Learning
- Web Application Security (OWASP Top 10)
- API Security & Authorization Issues (IDOR, BAC, Broken Auth)
- Network & Infrastructure Fundamentals
- Blue Team & Detection Concepts
- Purple Team workflows (Attack → Detection → Remediation)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Operating Systems:** Linux (Ubuntu, Kali), Windows  
- **Security Tools:** Burp Suite, Nmap, Gobuster, FFUF, Metasploit  
- **Security Labs:** DVWA, OWASP Juice Shop, VAmPI  
- **Virtualization & Containers:** VirtualBox, Docker  
- **Languages:** Python, Bash (basic), JavaScript (fundamentals)

---

## 📂 What You'll Find on My GitHub
- 🔐 Security testing labs and walkthroughs  
- 🧪 Proof-of-concept exploits (educational use only)  
- 🛡️ Detection, mitigation, and remediation notes  
- 🛠️ Small security tools built during learning  
- 📘 Structured reports and documentation

---

## 🧩 Learning Philosophy
I believe in **learning by doing**.

For every vulnerability I explore, I aim to:
- Understand the root cause  
- Analyze real-world impact  
- Study how it can be detected and prevented  

---

## 🎯 Goal
🟣 To grow into a well-rounded **Purple Teamer** by bridging offensive security techniques with defensive detection and response.
